1. Run the application: `python app.py`
2. Open http://localhost:5000 in your browser
3. Take screenshots of each section
4. Save them with the filenames listed above
5. Images will automatically appear in the README

## Image Guidelines

- **Resolution**: 1200x800 pixels or similar 3:2 aspect ratio
