## Technical Insights

### Feature Engineering vs End-to-End Learning

The results demonstrate that **well-designed feature engineering (MFCC) can outperform end-to-end deep learning** for specialized tasks like digit classification:

1. **Domain Knowledge**: MFCC features incorporate decades of speech processing research
2. **Efficiency**: Reduced dimensionality (156 vs 8000) leads to faster training
3. **Interpretability**: MFCC features have clear acoustic meaning
4. **Robustness**: Less susceptible to overfitting with smaller datasets

### CNN Performance Analysis

**Why CNNs underperformed**:
1. **Limited Dataset Size**: ~2,700 samples may be insufficient for deep CNN training
2. **Overfitting**: Larger parameter count (675K vs 85K) with relatively small dataset
3. **Raw Audio Complexity**: 1D CNNs struggle with temporal patterns in raw audio
4. **Training Dynamics**: Require more careful hyperparameter tuning

## Deployment Integration

### Flask App Integration

The trained models can be integrated into the main web application:

```python
# Recommended integration for best performance
from ml_training.inference import load_classifier

# Load best performing model
classifier = load_classifier("models", "mfcc")

# Replace existing processor
class MLAudioProcessor(AudioProcessor):
    def __init__(self):
        self.classifier = load_classifier("models", "mfcc")
    
    def process_audio(self, audio_data):
        result = self.classifier.predict(audio_data)
        return {
            'digit': str(result['predicted_digit']),
            'confidence': result['confidence'],
